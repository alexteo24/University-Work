As a data structure for the symbol table, I chose to implement a generic BST.

It's inner class, Node, will contain as attributes data of type T and left and right of type Node.

The BST has as attributes only the head of type Node, which will initially be null.

//The function will add data to the BST if the data is not already present
//data: the information we want to add to our BST
//return -
public void add(T data)


//The function will search for some data.
//data: the data we want to seach in our BST
//return: if the data is present, return the data or null otherwise
public T find(T data)


//Function to display the BST according to inorder traversal
//currentNode: the root of the BST we want to display
//-
private void print(Node currentNode)


//Wrapper for the print function to display the whole tree
public void displayTree()
